<h1 align="center">Pathfinding</h1>
An implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm. This algorithm is based on the Djastra algorithm, improving it and making the algorithm more effective and make the algorithm use less resources. This implementation is done in C++ and the visualizer is done using OpenGL which just consists of a simple grid.

# Mac
Unless your on an old version of macos, you cannot compile this project as Apple has depricated OpenGL.
